**ANOVA**

Ho: All group means are the same, : M1=M2=Mk
Ha: At least one group mean is not the same as the rest.

Idea: Compare the variability of the observed group means, 
X1, X2, Xk
with the variability within the groups.
==> compute an F-statistic and get a p-value
A low P-value represents evidence against the Ha.

**To do an ANOVA**

1) State the hypotheses
2) Visualize data
3) Run the Test using aov()
4) State a conclusion in ordinary human language. 
5) Consider which groups might be different

**Assumptions of ANOVA**

1) Observations are independent of one another 
2) In each group, the qualitative variable is normally-distributed. (Can be broken esp. for large samples)
3) The variances in group are equal (Can be broken esp. for large samples)
